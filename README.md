Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target). It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting linear equation that describes the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.

In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable, while in multiple linear regression, there are multiple independent variables.

The equation of a simple linear regression model can be represented as The equation y=mx+b, where :

y is the dependent variable (the variable we want to predict).

m represents the slope of the line and

x is the independent variable (the variable we use to make predictions)

b represents the intercept, is another way to represent linear regression.

(Thats how it works)

reg.predict([[2000]])

y=mx+b

y = 1.33429499*2000+689.2562730862312 

y = 3357.8462530862316

m = coefficient

x = 2000

b = intercept
